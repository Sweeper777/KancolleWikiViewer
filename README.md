# KancolleWikiViewer

This is a chrome extension that allows you to go to different pages of the KanColle Wiki just by typing in short commands in the address bar.

Every command begins with `kcw` followed by a space. `kcw` stands for **K**an**C**olle **W**iki

## Viewing quests

    kcw <quest ID>

Goes to the specified quest on the Quests page. `<quest ID>` is something like `A5` or `B20`, case insensitive

Example: `kcw B20` takes you to https://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/Quests#B20
